![Animation](https://github.com/clm-a/Blender-Models/blob/main/Robot/animation.gif?raw=true)

Simple model with armature controlled by cursors  
Cursors can slide along Z axis from 0 to 1m in local space.  
Controlled armature bones apply transform constraints based on cursor's local position.

Animation is composed of cursors movements instead of moving each arm bone.
